## Description
This is an application that allows the tracking of employees and roles in a quick easy manner as well as additions and changes. This app also interconnects the pieces so that managers are visible as are the names and roles and departments for the employee all visible. 

## Motivation for Development
Wanting to keep track of work and employees in an easier manner without having to create the front end. Allowing multiple pieces to be pulled in so that everything interconnects and can be seen quickly and at one time for the employee. 

## User Story
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

## Technologies Used: 
This application uses mysql, javascript and inquirer, node.js.


## Challenges 
A major challenge with this is the scratch sql. It was really challenging. I am going to have to work on that several more times.  


## Successes
Learning about scratch sql. Also becoming more familiar with node.js and seeing it work on a larger project. 


## Directions for Future Development
A front end section so that some who does not have computer experience can do the same thing as what is in the terminal.
